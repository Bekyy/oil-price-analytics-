## Overview 
* This analysis ultimately aims to enhance stakeholders' ability to understand and react to changes in Brent oil prices, contributing to improved decision-making in the energy sector.

## Objective
* The primary goal of this analysis is to study how significant political and economic events influence Brent oil prices. The specific objectives are:
1.	Identify Key Events: Recognize major political and economic events over the past decades that have significantly impacted Brent oil prices. These events include geopolitical conflicts, policy changes by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), global economic sanctions, and major financial crises.
2.	Quantify Event Impact: Measure and analyze how these events affect Brent oil price changes. This includes assessing price volatility, sudden price spikes or drops, and observing trends over short- and long-term periods after each event.
3.	Provide Actionable Insights: Generate clear, data-driven insights that can support investors, policymakers, and energy companies. These insights will enable stakeholders to make informed decisions, manage risk, and develop effective strategies in response to future events that may impact the oil market.

## Data
The dataset used for this analysis consists of historical Brent oil prices, covering daily prices from May 20, 1987, to September 30, 2022. The dataset includes two main fields:
1.	Date: Represents the date of the recorded Brent oil price, formatted as ‘day-month-year’ (e.g., 20-May-87). This comprehensive time range allows for an in-depth analysis of price trends over the past several decades, capturing the impact of numerous historical events.
2.	Price: This column reflects the price of Brent crude oil on the corresponding date, recorded in USD per barrel. The daily price data provides a granular view of fluctuations, enabling precise assessments of price changes in relation to specific events.
In addition to the Brent oil price dataset, relevant historical events were identified and compiled based on research from credible sources, including reports from the Energy Information Administration (EIA), OPEC publications, major news outlets, and global economic organizations. This additional data allows for annotating the Brent price timeline with key events, enabling a more accurate analysis of their impact.
